* Meta tags

  For quite a while I’ve been using, in my own documents, something I
  call “Meta tags” (or MTags) that is, tags used to convey information
  about the text within a document, but not directly related to the text.

  You could say these are HTML meta tags (=meta=), but slightly more
  terse and compact.

* Syntax

  MTags have a relatively simple form:

  1. An opening square bracket (=[=).
  2. A character, or a string, delimited by =｢= and =｣=, describing
     what the MTag is about, that is. A character or string is
     A description code, as described in [[Description Codes]].
  4. An opening parenthesis (=(=).
  5. The text the meta tag applies to.
  6. A closing parenthesis (=)=).
  7. A closing square bracket (=]=).
