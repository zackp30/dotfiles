;; Server handling
;; I use multiple Emacs servers, and had a problem where loading `config.org'
;; and tangling it into `config.el' ended up causing a lock.
;; So I went on the quest to make my own system to run them one at a time.
;; This involved:
;; 1. Running the servers in a contained manner (tmux!).
;; 2. Wait for a PID file to appear, which will happen a few seconds after `after-init-hook'
;; 3. Make Emacs servers depend on each other, for example:
;;   - fb-mapper depends on documents which depends on dotfiles which depends on server
;;
;; This system works really well.
