* Introduction
  
  Hi, I'm Zack Piper.

  I'm studying computer science at secondary school. It is going well
  since my main activity throughout secondary school has been programming
  in Ruby, and a mix of other programming languages.

  I am also studying business studies, art and digital photography, and
  ICT, which are all predominantly computer based, my favorite is still
  computer science.

  My main strength is understanding the syntax of new programming
  languages, of which I have understood the syntax of:

  -  Ruby --- an object oriented scripting language designed with
    readability in mind
  -  Some LISP variants
    - [[http://clojure.org][Clojure]] (50%) --- Java Virtual Machine based language which
      is a lot like LISP.
    - [[http://racket-lang.org][Racket]] (30%) --- an interesting language which is useful for
      implementing other languages.
    - [[http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/common-lisp.html][Common Lisp]] (60%) --- a standard of LISP
    - [[http://trac.sacrideo.us/wg/wiki/R7RSHomePage][Scheme]] (20%) --- a variant of LISP which is a lot more
      minimal
  - [[http://haskell.org][Haskell]] (5%) --- a very very interesting purely functional
    language, which implements static and strong typing

  Another main strength is programming in general, but it's still a hobby
  but I hope to get a full-time job in programming.

  I enjoy programming a lot, and that's why I want a full-time job.

** Awards

   During primary school I was registered on the gifted and talented
   register for ICT and science.

*** Details on my computing life

    (Updated and revised version of my work experience CV follows)

    I am 15 year old programmer, who likes Ruby, and is learning Haskell and
    Clojure. I have been fiddling with computers since the age of 10, when I
    first connected to IRC and started to learn more and more about
    programming. I since learned Python, moved onto Ruby, and also fiddle
    with Haskell, and Common Lisp.

    Since the age of 13 I was administering my own server (a virtual machine
    running on a friends virtualisation-capable dedicated server). My father
    now rents a dedicated server, which can run 30 small (512MB) virtual
    machines at the same time, when accounting for essential host system
    processes such as systemd, journald, sshd, and the Linux kernel itself.

    I thoroughly enjoy system administration, and programming, and am very
    insistent on getting the job done, and check multiple times if it works
    well.

    System administration is a good hobby of mine, of which I can spend
    hours a day fixing things.

    To my knowledge, I have yet to have a break in to any of my machines (I
    keep an eye on the logs (=journalctl -fl=) under a [[http://tmux.github.io][tmux]] session and
    employ an automated process (fail2ban) to ban attempted intrusions for
    me). root login is also disabled, and cryptographic keys are the only
    methods of logging in as root. My password manager uses a ~40 character
    password, and is encrypted with the GNU Privacy Guard (an OpenPGP
    implementation), and the password to my account on the machine is simply
    not guessable.
    
**** My server setup

***** Miscellaneous

      -  systemd is the init system
      -  openSUSE is the Linux distribution
      -  fail2ban keeps unauthorized clients out
      -  mysqld for random databases
      -  libvirtd is used to manage virtual machines
      -  Docker is used to manage applications which rely on containers.
      -  16GB RAM, 4 CPU cores.
      -  1TB disk.

     $ uname -a
     Linux xieshaij 4.1.12-1-default #1 SMP PREEMPT Thu Oct 29 06:43:42 UTC
     2015 (e24bad1) x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
      #+END_EXAMPLE

**** Web system

     -  Apache2 is the webserver
     -  php-fpm is the PHP interpreter
     -  Address: http://apertron.net

**** My document setup

     I use the GNU Emacs text editor (or VIM when I'm sudo'ing into a user
     that does not have my user-specific configuraton
     (https://github.com/zackp30/dotfiles) installed).

     I write all my schoolwork using Emacs in Markdown, using [[http://pandoc.org][Pandoc]],
     the Markdown processor, which compiles it into LaTeX, to later on be
     compiled to a standalone PDF document, after being preprocessed. (this
     is how this very document was produced). All of this is automated using
     my custom build rules written in [[http://haskell.org][Haskell]], and live reloaded by
     [[http://guardgem.org][Guard]]. My Emacs sessions runs under a [[http://tmux.github.io][tmux]] session, which
     uses [[https://github.com/powerline/powerline][tmux powerline]].

**** My miscellaneous setup

     -  Emails are, of course, written in Emacs.
     -  Programming done in, you guessed it: Emacs.
     -  Wanderlust and [[http://www.mutt.org/][mutt]] are my email clients.
     -  [[http://weechat.org][WeeChat]] is my IRC client.
     -  My version control of choice is [[http://git-scm.com][Git]].
     -  Linux distribution of choice is [[http://opensuse.org][openSUSE]].
     -  Todo list manager of choice is [[http://taskwarrior.org][taskwarrior]].
     -  Shell of choice is [[http://www.zsh.org/][zsh]]. 
     -  Browser of choice is Chromium /or/ [[http://elinks.cz][Elinks]] depending on if I'm
        using my phone with physical keyboard (limited credit, so using
        =elinks= over ssh without images is great for that).
     -  Programming language of choice is Ruby, or shell script when doing
       simple things.

**** Why do you use Linux?

     Linux is an operating system core, it manages application memory,
     drivers (keyboards, mouse, disk drives, USB).

***** Story

      I'm a Linux user since, I think, the age of 12 or 13, I'm 15 now.

      It started when I got tired with Windows XP at 11 and the waiting,
      dammit am I impatient sometimes, but waiting for a basic task such as
      shutting down just made me tired of Windows all together.

      A few months previously I had started participating in discussions in a
      channel on the freenode IRC network which was about a game, and as
      freenode usually goes, it was open source and most of the users used
      Linux.

      I kept on hearing about this Linux but wasn't that interested in it at
      the time. However, because the channel (and most of freenode) involved
      quite a bit of programming I started learning Python.

      A year passed and I was attempting to install GNU/Linux (specifically
      Ubuntu) on my new (technically old, but I had just got it for my
      birthday) PC, unfortunately it continually froze, for reasons unknown
      (probably a bad hard drive, or a lot of dust or something else...).

      Back then I was the type to give up on things, so I just continually
      nagged my father to try and install Ubuntu, he couldn't do it for the
      same reasons.

      After wanting Linux for a while I became determined to get Linux and
      ditch windows for good. So instead of Ubuntu I tried Linux Mint, being a
      derivative of Ubuntu(?) I didn't have high hopes, but it worked!

      I continued using it for another 6 months.

      During that time a friend on IRC gave me a virtual machine (which ran
      Ubuntu) on their server, I kept it for a year a bit until my father got
      me my own server.

      After the 6 months I got a new PC (which I still use!) I wanted to try
      something different.

      I decided to install openSUSE.

      I liked it a lot, and on the same Christmas I obtained a Raspberry Pi,
      and stuck with Debian on it for a while due to the lack of support other
      distros had for it.

      A year passed and I installed openSUSE on everything I could find:

      -  My brother's laptop
      -  My BeagleBone Black (another Raspberry Pi-like thing)
      -  My PC
      -  My server my father rents

      Up until recently, due to frequent kernel panics, my BeagleBoard and
      Raspberry Pi both run Arch Linux ARM, which is also rather nice.

      So, during that year I started learning programming a bit more, my
      friend on IRC told me about Ruby, and a [[http://tryruby.org][Ruby training site]], Ruby
      looked really nice so I've stuck with it since then.

      I then started turning into a power user.

      I learned basic VIM, and switched from KDE to AwesomeWM, and later to
      StumpWM, a window manager implemented in Common LISP.

      VIM was nice, but I wanted more power, and VIML was quite poor, and
      since I was quite interested in LISP, I switched to GNU Emacs, switched
      back after trying to get something to work, and then switched back to
      Emacs, which I am currently writing this application in.

      So, to answer the question I started using Linux because I like learning
      different things, and I love the command line interface.

***** Respecting my freedom

      Linux respects my freedom. As the user of software I have the
      right to freedom to use the software as I wish.

  tmux is AWESOME!

  [[http://tmux.github.io][tmux]] is short for "terminal multiplexer", it is "window management"
  for the standard terminal.
